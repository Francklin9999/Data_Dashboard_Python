# Diabetes Statistics Dashboard

This project is a web application built using Dash and Plotly, designed to visualize diabetes statistics across various countries. The application reads data from an Excel file (Excel_Projet.xlsx) and provides interactive visualizations, including bar charts and statistical tables. Users can select a country from a dropdown menu to view relevant statistics and compare them with global trends.

This project was for a statistical mathematics class at CÃ©gep in Winter 2022.
